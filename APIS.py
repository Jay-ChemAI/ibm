Service Oriented Approach
Most non-trivial web applications use services
They use services from other applications
 - Credit card charge 
 - Hotel Reservation Systems
Services publish the 'rules' applications must follow to make use of the service (API)

APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE
The API itself is largely abstract in that it specifies an interface and controls the behavior of the objects specified in that interface. The software that provides the functionality described 
by an API is said to be an 'implementation' of the API. An API is typically defined in terms of the programming language used to build an application

The compute resources to run these APIs are not 'free' 
The adata provided by these APIs is usually valuable
The data providers might limit the number of requests per day, demand an API 'key', or even charge for usage
They might change the rules as things progress..
